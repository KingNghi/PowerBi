# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Some key insights to take away from this project are: 
- The Technology category exhibits strong seasonal demand, particularly from August to December, driven by back-to-school promotions and holiday shopping, suggesting an opportunity for timely marketing campaigns.
- While Office Supplies show consistently high order volumes, profit margins are lower compared to Technology, indicating a need for promotional strategies to enhance profitability in a competitive market.
- The West region outperforms the East in Office Supplies, and major states like California and New York should be targeted with specific marketing efforts to capitalize on their robust sales potential, helping to drive growth across all product categories.

# Insights Deep Dive
### Sales trends:

- As for Technology category, more products were bought at the end of every year (beginning from August), thereby more sales generated. Prior to that period, the total orders were increasing steadily. This seasonal demand spike could be due to factors such as back-to-school promotions, holiday shopping…

- Regarding Office supplies category, the quantity were relatively high throughout the year, increasing as the time went on and peaked at September before having a decline in October, followed by a significant surge in again in November. Similar to Technology category, the peak in September likely corresponded to back-to-school event or beginning of a fiscal year for companies in the United States. Once they had bought enough supplies, they shifted priority to other things. The surge following this period could be the result of major promotion event in the US such as Black Friday, Cyber Monday, taking place in November.

- With respect to Furniture category, the pattern was the same to the Technology, the total orders were increasing steadily in first two-and-a-half quarter before rocketing in September, followed by a decline in October and surge in November.

### Product performance:

- Products in the Technology category generate the highest profits, followed by that in Office Supplies and Furniture respectively.  This category had consistently shown increasing profitability over the last 4 years and the year-over-year profit growth in 2017 was 27.5%, which was 1.5 times higher than the growth in 2016.
- Although products in the Office Supplies category did not yield as much profit as those in Technology category did, products in this category had significantly higher volume of orders than the other two categories combined (The total order quantity was 7676 for Office Supplies, while that of Technology and Furniture were 2363 and 2437 in the latest year).
- Regarding Furniture, this category was underperforming compared to the other two categories as it was signigicantly low in profit generated, about 3% compared to total profit in the latest year, prompting more strategies launched.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
